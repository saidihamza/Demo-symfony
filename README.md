Symfony Demo Application
The "Symfony Demo Application" serves as a reference application, exemplifying the implementation of best practices outlined in the Symfony Best Practices documentation.

Requirements
Ensure that your system meets the following prerequisites:

PHP 7.3 or a higher version
Enabled PDO-SQLite PHP extension
Fulfill Symfony's general application requirements.
Installation
To set up the Symfony Demo Application, you have two options:

Using Symfony Binary:

Download Symfony here to install the symfony binary on your computer.

Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
$ symfony new --demo my_project
Using Composer:

If you already have Composer installed, run:

bash
Copy code
$ composer create-project symfony/symfony-demo my_project
Usage
Executing the Symfony Demo Application is straightforward. Follow these steps:

If you have installed the Symfony binary, use the following commands:

bash
Copy code
$ cd my_project/
$ symfony serve
Access the application in your browser at the provided URL (typically https://localhost:8000).

If you don't have the Symfony binary, you can use the built-in PHP web server:

bash
Copy code
$ cd my_project/
$ php -S localhost:8000 -t public/
Alternatively, configure a web server such as Nginx or Apache to run the application.

Tests
Run tests with the following commands:

bash
Copy code
$ cd my_project/
$ ./bin/phpunit
Additional Information
For more details on Symfony best practices, refer to the official Symfony Best Practices documentation. Ensure your system meets the general Symfony application requirements. If needed, configure a web server using the guidelines provided in the Symfony documentation on web server configuration.
